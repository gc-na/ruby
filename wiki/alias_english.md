# Understanding the `alias` Keyword in Ruby: A Comprehensive Guide

## Synopsis
The `alias` keyword in Ruby is used to create a new name for an existing method or variable, allowing for easier reference or renaming without altering the original functionality.

## Documentation
The `alias` keyword is a powerful feature in Ruby that enables developers to define an alternative name for existing methods or variables within a class or module. This allows for improved code readability, the creation of method aliases, and can aid in deprecating old method names while maintaining compatibility with existing code.

### Purpose
- To create an alternative name for an existing method or variable.
- To maintain backward compatibility when renaming methods.
- To improve code clarity by providing more meaningful method names.

### Usage
The `alias` keyword can be used in classes, modules, and methods. It can only be used in the context of a class or module, and it cannot be used within methods. The syntax for creating an alias is simple:

```ruby
alias new_name old_name
```

### Details
- The alias can be created for instance methods, class methods, and variables.
- It is important to note that the `alias` keyword does not create a copy of the method; instead, it creates a reference to the original method.
- Aliases can be used to provide compatibility for deprecated methods, allowing code to transition smoothly to newer method names.

## Examples
### Basic Method Alias
```ruby
class Example
  def greet
    "Hello, World!"
  end

  alias hello greet
end

example = Example.new
puts example.greet  # Output: Hello, World!
puts example.hello  # Output: Hello, World!
```

### Using Alias for Method Renaming
```ruby
class Sample
  def old_method
    "This is the old method."
  end

  alias new_method old_method
end

sample = Sample.new
puts sample.old_method  # Output: This is the old method.
puts sample.new_method  # Output: This is the old method.
```

## Explanation
While using `alias`, it is important to keep in mind the following common pitfalls:
- `alias` is not the same as `alias_method`. The latter is a method provided by the `Module` class, which can be used for more complex scenarios involving method visibility and scopes.
- You cannot use `alias` with method arguments; it only works with method names.
- Make sure that the original method exists before creating an alias; otherwise, a `NameError` will be raised.

### Common Gotchas
- The `alias` keyword does not allow the use of parentheses. For example, `alias hello(greet)` will result in a syntax error.
- Aliases to private methods are only accessible within the defining class or module, while public methods can be accessed from outside.

## One Line Summary
The `alias` keyword in Ruby provides a way to create alternative names for existing methods or variables, enhancing code readability and facilitating method renaming.

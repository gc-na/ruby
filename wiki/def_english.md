# Understanding the 'def' Keyword in Ruby: Function Definition Made Simple

## Synopsis
The `def` keyword in Ruby is used to define methods, which are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. This is fundamental to Ruby's object-oriented programming paradigm.

## Documentation
In Ruby, the `def` keyword allows developers to create methods that encapsulate functionality, making code modular and easier to manage. When a method is defined using `def`, it can be invoked later in the program, allowing for code reuse and improved readability.

### Purpose
The primary purpose of `def` is to define a method that can take parameters, perform operations, and return values. This promotes the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle in programming.

### Usage
To define a method in Ruby, the syntax is as follows:

```ruby
def method_name(parameters)
  # method body
end
```

- **method_name**: A valid identifier for the method.
- **parameters**: An optional list of parameters that the method can accept.

### Details
- Methods can return values automatically by the last evaluated expression or explicitly using the `return` keyword.
- Methods can have default parameters, allowing for more flexible method calls.
- Ruby methods are first-class objects, which means they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other methods.

## Examples

### Basic Method Definition
```ruby
def greet(name)
  "Hello, #{name}!"
end

puts greet("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

### Method with Default Parameter
```ruby
def greet(name = "World")
  "Hello, #{name}!"
end

puts greet          # Output: Hello, World!
puts greet("Bob")   # Output: Hello, Bob!
```

### Returning a Value from a Method
```ruby
def add(a, b)
  a + b
end

result = add(5, 3)
puts result  # Output: 8
```

## Explanation
When using `def`, keep in mind the following common pitfalls and gotchas:

- **Method Overriding**: If a method is defined with the same name in a subclass, it will override the parent class's method. Ensure that this behavior is intentional.
- **Scope of Variables**: Variables defined within a method are not accessible outside of it, which can lead to confusion if not properly handled.
- **Naming Conventions**: Following Ruby's naming conventions, method names should be written in snake_case.

Be cautious with the use of the `return` keyword; while it can be used to return early from a method, Ruby automatically returns the value of the last executed expression if `return` is omitted.

## One Line Summary
The `def` keyword in Ruby is essential for defining methods, enabling code reuse and modular programming.

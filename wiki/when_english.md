# Understanding the `when` Keyword in Ruby: A Comprehensive Guide

## Synopsis
The `when` keyword in Ruby is an integral part of the `case` statement, allowing developers to execute code based on specific conditions. It streamlines conditional logic and enhances code readability.

## Documentation

### Purpose
The `when` keyword is used within a `case` statement to define multiple conditions against which an expression is evaluated. It provides a clear and concise way to handle multiple potential outcomes without the overhead of multiple `if...elsif` statements.

### Usage
The `case` statement evaluates an expression and compares it against various values defined in `when` clauses. If a match is found, the corresponding block of code is executed. The general syntax is as follows:

```ruby
case expression
when value1
  # code to execute if expression equals value1
when value2
  # code to execute if expression equals value2
else
  # code to execute if no matches are found
end
```

### Details
- The `case` expression is evaluated once, and each `when` condition is checked against the result.
- The `when` clauses can accept any Ruby object, including ranges and arrays.
- The `else` clause is optional and will execute if none of the `when` conditions are met.
- You can use multiple values in a `when` clause by separating them with commas.

## Examples

### Basic Example
```ruby
day = "Monday"

case day
when "Monday"
  puts "Start of the week!"
when "Friday"
  puts "Almost the weekend!"
else
  puts "Just another day."
end
```
*Output:* `Start of the week!`

### Using Ranges
```ruby
age = 25

case age
when 0..12
  puts "Child"
when 13..19
  puts "Teenager"
when 20..64
  puts "Adult"
else
  puts "Senior"
end
```
*Output:* `Adult`

### Multiple Conditions
```ruby
color = "blue"

case color
when "red", "blue", "green"
  puts "This is a primary color."
when "yellow", "cyan", "magenta"
  puts "This is a secondary color."
else
  puts "Unknown color."
end
```
*Output:* `This is a primary color.`

## Explanation
While using the `when` keyword offers clear syntax, developers should be aware of a few common pitfalls:
- **Fall-through Behavior**: If a `when` clause matches, all subsequent lines will execute until encountering an `end` or a break in the flow. To prevent this, make sure to use `break` or `return` statements if needed.
- **Type Comparison**: Ensure the types being compared in `when` clauses are compatible. For instance, comparing a string to an integer will result in no matches.
- **No Implicit Return**: Unlike methods, the `case` statement does not implicitly return a value. If you need to capture the result, assign it to a variable.

## One Line Summary
The `when` keyword in Ruby is used within `case` statements to evaluate multiple conditions and execute corresponding code blocks.

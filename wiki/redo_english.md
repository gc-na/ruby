# Understanding the `redo` Keyword in Ruby: A Comprehensive Guide

## Synopsis
The `redo` keyword in Ruby is used to repeat the execution of the current iteration of a loop without re-evaluating the loop's condition. It is primarily utilized in conjunction with block structures such as `while`, `until`, `for`, and iterators.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The `redo` keyword allows developers to restart the execution of the current iteration of a loop. This can be particularly useful when certain conditions are met, and you want to retry the loop's body without moving to the next iteration.

### Usage
The `redo` keyword can be employed within loops like `while`, `until`, and iterators. When `redo` is called, the program control jumps to the beginning of the loop's body, executing all the statements again.

### Syntax
```ruby
loop do
  # Loop body
  redo if condition # This will restart the current iteration if condition is true
end
```

## Examples
### Basic Example
Here's a simple example demonstrating the use of `redo` in a loop:

```ruby
counter = 0

loop do
  counter += 1
  puts "Counter: #{counter}"

  # If counter is not equal to 3, redo the iteration
  redo if counter != 3

  break if counter >= 5
end
```
**Output:**
```
Counter: 1
Counter: 2
Counter: 3
Counter: 4
```

### Example with Condition
In this example, we use `redo` to retry a user input until it meets a specific condition:

```ruby
loop do
  puts "Please enter a number greater than 10:"
  number = gets.to_i

  redo if number <= 10

  puts "Thank you! You entered: #{number}"
  break
end
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
1. **Infinite Loops**: Using `redo` without changing the conditions that lead to it can result in an infinite loop. Ensure that the conditions are changing or that there's a proper exit mechanism in place.
   
2. **Overuse**: While `redo` can be powerful, overusing it can lead to code that is difficult to read and understand. It's often better to use a clear looping structure or condition rather than relying on `redo`.

3. **Scope Issues**: Variables defined in the loop may have scope limitations. Ensure that any variables you rely on in the loop are appropriately defined outside if needed.

### Additional Notes
- `redo` cannot be used outside of a loop. Attempting to do so will lead to a `LocalJumpError`.
- Other control flow keywords like `next` (to skip to the next iteration) or `break` (to exit the loop) serve different purposes and should not be confused with `redo`.

## One Line Summary
The `redo` keyword in Ruby allows you to repeat the current iteration of a loop without re-evaluating its condition, making it useful for retrying operations under specific circumstances.

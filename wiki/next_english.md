# Understanding the `next` Keyword in Ruby: Skip Iteration with Ease

## Synopsis
The `next` keyword in Ruby is a control flow statement that allows developers to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next one. It is particularly useful in loops where certain conditions should prevent the execution of subsequent code.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The `next` keyword is used within looping constructs in Ruby, such as `for`, `while`, and `each`. When `next` is encountered, Ruby ignores the remaining code in the current iteration and continues with the next iteration of the loop.

### Usage
The `next` statement can be employed in various looping contexts. The general syntax is as follows:
```ruby
loop do
  # Code before 'next'
  next if condition
  # Code after 'next'
end
```

### Details
- The `next` keyword can be combined with conditional statements to control when to skip an iteration.
- It can be used in any loop construct: `for`, `while`, `until`, and enumeration methods like `each`.
- When `next` is executed, any code following it within the loop block will not be executed for that iteration.

## Examples
### Basic Example with Each
```ruby
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].each do |number|
  next if number.even?  # Skip even numbers
  puts number           # Outputs: 1, 3, 5
end
```

### Example with While Loop
```ruby
counter = 0
while counter < 5
  counter += 1
  next if counter == 3  # Skip when counter is 3
  puts counter          # Outputs: 1, 2, 4, 5
end
```

### Example with For Loop
```ruby
for i in 1..5
  next if i == 2 || i == 4  # Skip 2 and 4
  puts i                    # Outputs: 1, 3, 5
end
```

## Explanation
While the `next` keyword is straightforward, there are common pitfalls to be aware of:

- **Misplaced `next`**: If placed outside of a loop, it will raise a `LocalJumpError`. Ensure that `next` is used within the context of a loop.
  
- **Not Using `next` Effectively**: Overusing `next` can make code less readable. Consider the overall control flow and readability when deciding to use it.

- **Condition Logic**: Ensure conditions for `next` are correctly defined to avoid skipping unintended iterations.

## One Line Summary
The `next` keyword in Ruby is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and jump to the next, enhancing control over loop execution.
